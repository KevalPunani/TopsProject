            <h4>What's Arm64 & Armeabi?</h4>
            <p>If you're someone who uses a smartphone, you might have come across the terms "arm64" and "armeabi" while
                downloading apps. These terms refer to the type of processor architecture that your device uses. Knowing
                which app to download can be confusing, but understanding the differences between the two can help you
                make the right choice.</p>
            <p>Firstly, let's understand what these terms mean. ARM is a type of processor architecture that is widely
                used in smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. It stands for "Advanced RISC Machine," and it is
                a type of processor that is known for its energy efficiency and performance.</p>
            <p><b>Armeabi</b> is an older version of the ARM processor architecture. It was first introduced in 1995 and
                was widely used in early Android devices. It is a 32-bit processor that is now obsolete and is no longer
                supported by many app developers.</p>
            <p><b>Arm64</b>, on the other hand, is a newer and more advanced version of the ARM architecture. It is a
                64-bit processor that provides better performance and energy efficiency than its predecessor. It is
                widely used in modern Android devices and is the recommended processor architecture for downloading most
                apps.</p>
            <p>If, however, your device uses an older 32-bit processor, then you should download the armeabi version of
                the app. This will ensure that the app is compatible with your device and runs smoothly. However, it's
                important to note that armeabi is an older architecture and is no longer supported by many app
                developers. So, if possible, it's recommended that you upgrade to a device that uses a 64-bit processor.
            </p>

            <h4>What about universal version?</h4>
            <p>In addition to arm64 and armeabi, there is also a universal version of an app that is compatible with
                both 32-bit and 64-bit processors. The universal version is designed to provide maximum compatibility
                with all devices, regardless of the type of processor architecture they use.</p>
            <p>The universal version of an app is also known as the "fat binary" version. It includes both the arm64 and
                armeabi versions of the app, which allows it to run on devices that use either processor architecture.
                This means that if you download the universal version of an app, you won't have to worry about whether
                your device uses a 32-bit or 64-bit processor.</p>
            <p>The downside to the universal version of an app is that it can take up more storage space on your device
                since it includes both versions of the app. Additionally, the universal version may not always provide
                the best performance since it is designed to be compatible with both processor architectures.</p>

            <h4>So, which version should you download?</h4>
            <p>If your device uses a 64-bit processor, it's recommended that you download the arm64 version of the app.
                This will ensure that the app runs smoothly and provides optimal performance. Most modern devices use
                arm64 processors, so it's likely that you'll need to download the arm64 version of most apps. However,
                if the app is not available in arm64, or if you're unsure which version to download, you can opt for the
                universal version. If your device uses a 32-bit processor, then you can download either the armeabi or
                universal version of the app.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>In summary, the decision to download either arm64 or armeabi version of an app depends on the processor
                architecture of your device. If you have a 64-bit processor, then download the arm64 version, and if you
                have a 32-bit processor, then download the armeabi version. The universal version of an app can provide
                maximum compatibility with all devices, but it may not always provide the best performance. If possible,
                it's recommended that you download the arm64 version if your device supports it. However, if you're
                unsure which version to download or if the arm64 version is not available, you can opt for the universal
                version for maximum compatibility. Understanding these differences can help you make the right choice
                and ensure that you get the best performance from your apps.</p>
