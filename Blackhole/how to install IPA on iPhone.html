            <p>iPhones are known for their security and closed operating system, which makes it challenging to install third-party applications outside of the App Store. However, there are ways to install .ipa files on your iPhone without jailbreaking your device.</p>
            <h4>What's an IPA?</h4>
            <p>An .ipa file is an iOS application archive file, which contains the app's binary code, resources, and metadata. There are several third-party app installers available, such as AltStore, Scarlet, TweakBox, and AppValley, which allow you to install .ipa files on your iPhone without jailbreaking. We'll discuss some of those method in this post.</p>

            <h4>Method 1: Using AltStore [PC required]</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Download and install AltStore on your computer from the official website.</li>
                <li>Connect your iPhone to your computer using a USB cable.</li>
                <li>Open AltStore which you installed on your computer (it might just show up as a little icon in your notification tray) and click on the "Install AltStore" option.</li>
                <li>Enter your Apple ID and password to sign in to AltStore.</li>
                <li>Once installation is done, AltStore will appear on your iPhone, open it</li>
                <li>Click on the "+" icon and select the .ipa file you want to install.</li>
                <li>Wait for the installation to complete, and the app will appear on your iPhone's home screen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Method 2: Using Scarlet App</h4>
            <p>Here's how you can install the .ipa file using Scarlet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Download Scarlet on your iPhone from the official website.</li>
                <li>Open Scarlet and click on the "Files" tab.</li>
                <li>Click on the "+" icon and select the .ipa file you want to install.</li>
                <li>Wait for the app to upload to Scarlet's server.</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
